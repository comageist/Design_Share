Sorry about the orientation, but I'm sure you can figure it out. The WAGO holder can be used with the DIN Clip or it can be mounted to an extrusion.
2x M3x12mm (for the clip).
2x M3x10mm (for extrusion).
2x 5mm threaded heat-set inserts (Voron standard).
Use standard Voron printing settings. (I use some cooling, but whatever works for your printer).
These parts were designed based on other mods I found for Voron printers that I modified and improved for my own needs. 
Kudos to those who came up with the original ideas. =)
